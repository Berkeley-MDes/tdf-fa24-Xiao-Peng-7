# Week 4 Digital Ecosystem Map #
## Week of 09/26/2024
This week I started with creating a digital ecosystem map of Amazon Go - a smart retailing experience integrated with IoT.
The Amazon Go smart retail ecosystem integrates sensors (like cameras, weight sensors, and RFID), software (including computer vision algorithms, inventory management, and a mobile app), and connectivity (IoT network, Wi-Fi, and cloud computing) to create a seamless shopping experience. As customers enter the store, sensors track their actions, update a virtual shopping cart, and automatically charge their account upon exit. This data flows through real-time processing, enabling inventory management, customer behavior analysis, and continuous system optimization, creating an automated and personalized retail environment.<br/><br/>

# Week 3 Computational Design Project One #
## Week of 09/19/2024
### Reflection
This week, my focus was primarily on my computational design project. I designed and 3D-printed a customizable jewelry box integrated with an AirPods holder. The process taught me valuable skills in integrating multiple functionalities into a single product. Specifically, I learned about the importance of ensuring precision in the design phase to guarantee that both the jewelry and AirPods fit perfectly into the compartments.<br/><br/> The learning process involved iterating through several design versions in CAD software to achieve the ideal dimensions and aesthetic. The current state of the project is promising, with a fully functioning prototype that demonstrates the customization aspect and the seamless integration of the AirPods holder.<br/><br/>
### Speculation
Moving forward, I aim to enhance the customization options of the jewelry box by adding features like adjustable compartments or different material finishes to appeal to a broader audience. Iâ€™m also considering embedding a small wireless charging pad for AirPods within the holder. This would push the boundaries of practicality and tech integration. From an industry perspective, customizable and multifunctional items are gaining popularity. I recently came across an article discussing modular and customizable designs in 3D-printed products.<br/><br/>

# Week 2 Computational Design Phone Stand #
## Week of 09/12/2024
This week I started with using Rhino and Grasshopper for computational design project. I learned some tutorials to know the basic interface & command in Rhino and Grasshopper. Based on that I also tried a few things on the example file of the cellphone stand. 
Here's the diagram I draw for the program. Since the program is very complicated for me to understand, reading through the notes of each modules and visaulizing their connections help me better understand how this system works.<br/><br/>

I also changed many parameters inside the control panel of grasshopper and bake different forms of phone stand. I think this process helps me better understand the advantages of computational design - we can easily generate many variations frm the same piece of code. <br/><br/>

Apart from that I followed some tutorials on youtube to create some basic boxes and perform boolean operation in grasshopper. Here's my progess on that.<br/><br/>

I also tried to replace the nested spheres with other geometric shapes, but I encounter some problems - I figured out which part I should modify and the output do change. However it always indicates that the assembly is not good :( <br/><br/>

# Week 1 Getting Started with Studio #
## Week of 08/29/2024

During my first week at Jacobs, I get familiar with the different machines and tools in the studio. I passed the GSW module and participated in the Form3 Resin Printer workshop. Apart from that I also completed my first laser-cutting project - I downloaded a SVG source file of a simple weaving toolkit from [here](https://www.instructables.com/Laser-Cut-Mini-Frame-Loom-Weaving/). Then I printed it out using the laser-cutting machine with 3mm Plywood.<br/>I think this is just a starting point of the studio making and I look forward to exploring other machines and materials in the next few weeks (especially as I start to learn Rhino & Grasshopper)!
