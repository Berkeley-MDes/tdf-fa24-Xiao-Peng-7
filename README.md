# Week 1: Getting Started with Studio #
## Week of 08/29/2024

During my first week at Jacobs, I get familiar with the different machines and tools in the studio. I passed the GSW module and participated in the Form3 Resin Printer workshop. Apart from that I also completed my first laser-cutting project - I downloaded a SVG source file of a simple weaving toolkit from [here](https://www.instructables.com/Laser-Cut-Mini-Frame-Loom-Weaving/). Then I printed it out using the laser-cutting machine with 3mm Plywood. I think this is just a starting point of the studio making and I look forward to exploring other machines and materials in the next few weeks (especially as I start to learn Rhino & Grasshopper)!
